Analysis examples:....

First you'll want to find the trace you're looking for, maybe:
grep -l SEGV strace.*  # find the one(s) which segfaulted
grep -l "/path/to/my/page.html"   # find the one which took that request

How many SELECT queries? : grep -c SELECT strace.1234
Show all SELECT queries  : cat strace.1234 | egrep -o 'SELECT.*\ =\ '
Show all PHP file opens  : cat strace.1234 | egrep -o 'open.*php'

Note: Tracing live processes may not show many PHP file opens if there's an Opcode Cache running.
See also 'strace-single.sh' to trace a single run from the command line. 


!! Don't forget to delete them after analysis. !!"
